  "description": "Something is wrong with the Universe, and you know exactly what it is. We used to live in a candy-colored age, full of wonder and danger in equal measure. Standing over the balanced Universe were its mighty guardians, the Time Ladies. A great war destroyed all but one of them. She was the Earth's defender, protecting it time and again from alien threats. She was a god humbled by death. She was your friend. She was the Doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then she died.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the Doctor's enemies gather and plot, scheming to claim the Universe for themselves. Only you, her stalwart and learned companions, stand against the encroaching darkness. It's a good thing she trained you so well, isn't it? ",
